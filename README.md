# Trains
Problem 3


There is basically 3 main classes:
First is Distance : it is basically executes the distance according to user's request.
Second is Trips : it executes recursive tree search  to find all possible paths.
Third is ShortParh : it uses Dijkstra algorithm to search shortest path 

notes: 
used treeMap class(key/value)
used graphInfo.properties as a command file.
command.txt holds inputs that wanted to find. (ex:distance AD ?)
graph-input holds distance of each path.
